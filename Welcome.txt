OberonX is command based. All text on the screen can be executed as a command. 
To execute commands simply middle mouse click the command text.

Commands usually have this form: Application . command. 
E.g: Edit.open is one such command

Command can have arguments passed to them. Arguments are a list of space separated words. 
To mark the end of the arguments use any special character that is not part of the command.
E.g: You can use !, ?, :, ; etc, but cannot use space, / or \.
